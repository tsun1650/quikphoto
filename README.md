i realized the mac photos app doesn't have any way to sort photos by size. how am i supposed to clean up my storage??? i guess i can download an app on my iphone but i want to do this on my MACBOOK. 


quickphoto allows you to sort your library by size so that you can see your biggest photos and videos.
this was a fun experiment to use cursor + replit to see what a prototype could look like. it mostly works! 


TO-DO:
* get video playback to work
* bulk selection of files
* keyboard navigation
* fix find similiar files
